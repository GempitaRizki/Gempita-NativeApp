# Gempita-NativeApp
//HOW TO RUN THIS APPLICATION .

1. do the installation with a click yarn install / npm install 

2. expo start 

3. connect app with barcode expo



// Since computers cannot access Android Studio, I apologize for not creating this program in an APK or iOS form. To execute the program using Expo, though, I used a different approach.
Overall, there are still a lot of functions that haven't been implemented because of time restrictions, therefore the program isn't flawless.
